# LANDING PAGES EDITOR

## Note

## About the project
- The final goal of this project is to take a standard landing page and to be able to customize it at one's ease. 
- For now it is just editing a basic landing page with Jquery, and the changed data is neither saved nor persistent.
- The short term goals are to save changed data and to return the code or the template's files to the user.
- This is only a test version and probably it will be taken to a nodejs project where the goals will be easier to make.

## How to colaborate
- You can fork the project, clone it on your computer, add improvements and fix errors. Then you can pull request and if I see that no functionality was broken I will merge both versions.

## TODO
- Think how the tamplate's code or even the files could be returned to the user.
- Evaluate different options (nodejs backend, start the project again in a better way, etc).
